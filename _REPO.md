# Github Repository Documentation

## Workflow

Features and bugs are recorded as issues in this repository. Issues are grouped into milestones with a clear due date. After finishing a milestone, I should start planning for the next milestone.

### Managing issues and milestones

Issues and milestones are managed by Github. For better visualization of the milestones, I duplicate them in GitKraken Timeline and keep them in sync. However, issues will not be duplicated as it doesn't provide much value.

### Branching strategy

- Each issue will have its own branch. The branch naming convention is `<issue number>-<issue description (linked with dash)>`.
- Each commit should start with a gitmoji.
- Once an issue is finished, raise an PR with the basic template.
- Merge PR and delete the issue branch.
