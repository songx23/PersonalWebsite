## Handy Content Tools

In the last part of the book, the author has listed many useful tools that help content creation. I have used some of them and some tools I like are not on the list. So I want to share my list of favourite writing tools.

### Research tools

While researching for the topic we're writing, we need a place where we can keep our sources and notes down. Research tools come into play to help us organize research materials. You might already have a preferred notebook application and I encourage you to stick with it as you are already familiar with it. If you haven't got a favourite tool for note-taking, here's my list of recommendations.

1. Pocket: pocket is a handy browser extension where you can save any web pages and read it for later (offline). It's perfect for saving source material and ideas when researching. You can also use tags to organize the web pages which I do all the time.
2. Google Keep: keep is one of the many applications from Google Suite. It is probably not as popular as OneNote from Microsoft but essentially they are pretty much the same except Keep is much slimmer. Keep provides all the basic features with a digital notebook needs. And it's very fast.
3. Mind Meister: Mind Meister (MM) is a great tool for creating a mind map. It's a product with paid subscription plans but it also provides a free version. I think the free version is enough for personal use.  
4. Good old pen and paper: Nothing beats the good old pen and paper. It is messy and takes more time but sometimes, you gotta admit, writing on paper give you a different satisfying feeling that typing can't offer.

### Writing tools

Now, it's time to talk about writing tools. I always use Markdown when writing my blogs. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that mostly used in the software industry. Therefore, my tool selection is focused on good Markdown support.

1. VS Code: VS Code is a text editor that supports lots of (programming) languages via extensions. With the Markdown extension, you can live preview your Markdown. Other popular text editors like Sublime Text, Atom or even Vim works the same.
2. iA Writer: I came across iA Writer when searching for a good writing tool on Mac OS. Its beautifully clean user interface caught my eyes instantly. Apart from that, it also has features like focus mode, full Markdown support, PDF preview, etc. However, there is one thing that turned me down. Although the app itself is cross-platform, you will have to purchase it for each platform that you want to use it on. And it's not a cheap application, selling at about AUD 45 per platform.

### Editing tools

Editing tool is very important to me as English is not my first language. I will need some help with proofreading what I write. Of course, as the author mentioned in the book, a good editor is very important to any writers out there. While I don't think I can afford a good human editor, there are plenty of options for a robot alternative.  

1. Grammarly: Grammarly is the only editing tool I've used. It packs with many features with typo correction, grammar error detection, word suggestions, etc. The best part is this tool is free to use and cross-platform. It also has a premium subscription which offers more features like readability check, vocabulary enhancement suggestions, plagiarism detection, etc. I've seen it on sale for 50% off plenty of time, if you purchase the subscription at that price, I wouldn't say it's a bad investment. However, I would be happy to just use the free version as well because it is a robot, after all, the suggestions are repetitive. You can grasp the gist of it and avoid making the same mistake.
