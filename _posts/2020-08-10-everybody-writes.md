## Handy Content Tools

In the last part of the book, the author has listed many useful tools that helps content creation. I have used some of them and some tools I like are not on the list. So I want to share my own list of favorite writing tools.

### Research tools

While researching for the topic we're writing, we need a place where we can keep our sources and notes down. Research tools come into play to help us organize research materials. You might already have a preferred notebook application and I encourage you to stick with it as you are already familiar with it. If you haven't got a favorite tool for note taking, here's my list of recommendations.

1. Pocket: pocket is a handy browser extension where you can save any web pages and read it for later (offline). It's perfect for saving source material and ideas when researching. You can also use tags to organize the web pages which I do all the time.
2. Google Keep: keep is one of the many applications from Google Suite. It is probably not as popular as OneNote from Microsoft but essentially they are pretty much the same except Keep is much slimmer. Keep provides all the basic features a digital notebook needs. And it's very fast.
3. Mind Meister: Mind Meister (MM) is a great tool for creating mind map. It's a product with paid subscription plans but it also provides a free version. I think the free version is enough for personal use.  
4. Good old pen and paper: Nothing beats the good old pen and paper. It is messy and takes more time but sometimes, you gotta admit, writing on paper give you a different satisfying feeling that typing can't offer.
