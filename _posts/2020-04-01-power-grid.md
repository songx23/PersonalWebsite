excerpt: Our lives are more or less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic by now. No doubt this is a terrible event for all of us and we want to get over it as soon as possible. However, it's a bit (very) hard to say goodbye to social life entirely and be happy to stay at home for the foreseeable future. So I spent some efforts to "bring" my friends together to play one of our favorite table-top board games, power grid. And of course, we are not physically together, please STAY AT HOME!

Australians had a rough start in 2020, a long and devastating bush fire took many precious things away from us, firemen, houses, wildlife, trees and so on. Not long after we finally got over the disaster, a pandemic hit us again and this time, we lost even more lives. COVID-19 has been spreading wildly across the globe and there's no sign of it slowing down at the moment. Most of the impacted countries have imposed some kind of rules to help stopping the spread. Australia is currently in stage 3 lock down, which means all of us should stay at home and avoid going out. No pubs, no friends gathering, no overseas travel. It's quite hard to get used to this new way of living. Before all of these, I longed for working from home because I have better setup at home than in the office. Whereas after two weeks of working from home, I kinda miss everything I had in the office, especially human interactions, badly.  

One day, I was chatting with my partner about how I miss the times we sat together with friends and play Power Grid and how unfortunate this game doesn't have an online version. All of a sudden, she said "why don't we move this game online?" I laughed and replied "I'm not a game developer, plus how much effort do you think it will take to virtualize such a complicated game? Even after playing it three times, we still need to go back to the rule book." She dragged me up from the sofa and said confidently "Not necessary, it can be quite easy, in fact, I have a perfect tool to do this, come check this out." I was reluctant to move my body but I gave in and walked to our study with her.  

She opened her laptop and went to a website called "Figma". I asked "I've heard you talking about Figma, what is it exactly?"  
"I use it everyday for work. It's like a drawing pad but you can work on it collaboratively with others in real time. Help em take out the game board of Power Grid."  
I was still not quite sure what she's up to but I took our the game board as she asked. She quickly shot a photo of the game board and uploaded to Figma. Then she started to drag icons representing game elements such as resources (coal, oil, etc), cities and power plants onto it. After about 10 to 15 minutes, she asked me to open up a link from my laptop. What in front of me is a mock up of the game, I can see cities tokens, resource tokens placed on the game map, looked just like it's a photo of the game.

"You can drag your tokens on or off the game board easily like this. We can start a group voice chat and play Power Grid on Figma just like in real life." She started to explain.  
"Very interesting! Moving tokens totally works. However, how can we represent the power plant market on Figma? We can't shuffle cards on it, can we?" I replied.  
She shook her head, "No, I don't know how to program that kind of stuff. That's what your job."  
I shrugged, "How am I suppose to know how to program stuff on Figma, I've never used it before... Hold on, we don't have to use Figma, I think I can write an app to represent the power plant market." Lots of ideas flew through my head. Fundamentally, the power plant market is an array of numbers ordered and shown in certain ways to players. It shouldn't be a hard program to code.  
"Challenge accepted!" I said excitedly. "I will write an app for the power plant market and you can work on the game board, adding all the elements."  
She smiled and said "Sounds like a plan, can you finish your app by the end of next week? I want to play this with friends on Saturday."  
"No problem, I can hack something up quickly. It's not gonna look good by the way, I suck at UI stuff, you have to accept that."  
"I will take whatever you build as long as it works." said she.
It was a Saturday evening and we were excited about this little project.
