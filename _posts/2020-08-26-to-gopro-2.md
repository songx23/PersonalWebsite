*Before we start, you can find the code used in this tutorial in this [repository](https://github.com/songx23/RoadToGoPro).*

## Primitive types

Primitive types are the most basic types we use in any programming languages. We're going to cover the most common four primitive types used in Go. They are boolean, integer, float and string. Let's get right into it.  

### Boolean

Boolean is the simplest primitive type. It has only two possible values, true and false.

```go
// primitive type: boolean
var isGoAwesome bool
isGoAwesome = false  // just kidding!
isGoAwesome = true
fmt.Println(isGoAwesome) // output: true
```

### Integer

Go has multiple integer types. We can categorise them into two groups.  
The first group is signed integers, in plain English, signed integers are `+ints & -ints & zero`. Furthermore, we can use different signed integer types depending on the size. For example, for storing a 8 bit signed integer (-128 to 127), we can use `int8`. These are the other sizes, `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`.  
The other group is unsigned integers, which means `+ints & zero`. Similarly, there are different types of unsigned integers depending on size. For instance, for storing an 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 255), we can use `uint8`. These are the other sizes, `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`.  
You might notice that type `int` and `uint` do not have a specific size attached. Their size is dynamic, but top at 32 bits. To be noted, they are different than `int32` and `uint32`. The later ones have a fixed size (32 bits).  
Normally, if you don't have a specific use case, using `int` to present integer is a good enough choice. But if you have a specific reason, for instance, you want to use byte, then you should pick unsigned integer `uint8` type because 1 byte has a fixed size of 8 bits. The `byte` type in Go is an alias for `uint8`.  

```go
// primitive type: integer
var integer int
integer = -10
integer = 10
fmt.Println(integer) // output: 10

var followerCount uint32
followerCount = 10000
// overflow error
// followerCount = -1000
fmt.Println(followerCount) // output: 10000
```

### Float

Like integers, float also has two types to accommodate numbers in different sizes. They are `float32` and `float64`.  
`float32` can store a 32-bit floating-point number and `float64` can store a 64-bit floating-point number.  
*`float32` is the equivalent of `float` type in Java/C# and `float64` is the equivalent of `double` type*

```go
// primitive type: float
var balance float32
balance = 10000.01
fmt.Println(balance) // output: 10000.01
```

### String

String is text or a group of characters.  

```go
// primitive type: string
var text string
text = "Go is fun."
fmt.Println(text) // output: Go is fun.
```

### nil

`nil` is a special value in Go, you might know it by other names like `null`. `nil` means zero value. For primitive types mentioned above, they have a default value and their value cannot be assigned as `nil`. Here are the default values for each mentioned primitive types.  

|primitive type|default value|
|----|-------------|
|boolean|false|
|integer family|0|
|float family|0.0|
|string|""|

### Declare variable

In the example code, the way we declare a variable is a bit verbose. We declare a variable first and then assign a value to it. Rest assured, there is an easier (also recommended) way to do the same thing in one line.  

```go
// import "reflect"
isGoAwesome := true
fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(isGoAwesome)) // output: bool
integer := 100
fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(integer)) // output: int
float := 100.1
fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(float)) // output: float64
text := "Go is fun"
fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(text)) // output: string
```

When declaring variables like that, Go implicitly interprets the type of a variable by the value assigned to it.

## Composite types

Composite types are made of basic or composite types. We will use composite types a lot in Go when building applications because they can be the representation of real-world objects.  
`Array`, `struct`, `pointer`, `function`, `interface`, `slice`, `map` and `channel` types are the supported composite types in Go. However, we are not going to cover all of them in this tutorial. We will introduce `pointer`, `function` and `channel` types when we have a more appropriate context in the future tutorials, stay tuned.

### Array

An array is a list of elements with a defined size. It can be represented as `[n]T`, where `n` is the array size and `T` is the type for the array. In Go, an array can only contain elements of a single type and its size can not be changed.  
Here is an example of a string array.  

```go
// composite type: array
var shoppingList [3]string
shoppingList[0] = "Milk"
shoppingList[1] = "Avocado" //smash it
shoppingList[2] = "Beer"
fmt.Println(shoppingList) // output: [Milk Avocado Beer]
// error if you want to add more elements than the array can fit
shoppingList[3] = "out of bounds"

// declare arrays in a simpler way
simpleShoppingList := [3]string{"Milk", "Avocado", "Beer"}
fmt.Println(simpleShoppingList) // output: [Milk Avocado Beer]

// make compiler do even more work, in case you don't want to count the size
lazyShoppingList := [...]string{"Milk", "Avocado", "Beer"}
fmt.Println(lazyShoppingList) // output: [Milk Avocado Beer]
```

To access elements in an array, we need to specify an index. Yes, Go is like most of the other programming languages, its index starts from 0, instead of 1.

```go
// to get avocado from my shopping list, I need its index
avocado := shoppingList[1]
// fmt package can do better than this but let's stick with Println for now
fmt.Println("Smash ", avocado) // output: Smash  Avocado
```

### Slice

Slice type is very similar to array, except it is dynamically-sized. Its representation is `[]T`, where `T` is the type for the slice. Same as the array type, slice can only store one type of elements. In practical, slice is used way more often than array.  

```go
// You can stuff as many kinds of bread as you can imagine in this slice.
bread := []string{"ficelle", "la baguette", "brioche"}
fmt.Println(bread) // output: [ficelle la baguette brioche]

// another way to declare slice
makeBread := make([]string, 3)
makeBread[0] = "ficelle"
makeBread[1] = "la baguette"
makeBread[2] = "brioche"
fmt.Println(makeBread) // output: [ficelle la baguette brioche]

// creating slice from array/slice
breadArr := [3]string{"ficelle", "la baguette", "brioche"}
breadSlice := breadArr[0:3]
fmt.Println(breadSlice) // output: [ficelle la baguette brioche]
```

We use the `make` function to create a slice with a defined initial size. In the example above, we made a slice of strings with an initial length of 3. Of course, you can still append more elements in that slice.  

```go
makeBread = append(makeBread, "new bread")
fmt.Println(makeBread) // output: [ficelle la baguette brioche new bread]
```

We can also create a "slice" from an existing array by using `array[i,j]` syntax. It cuts from index `i`, which is the starting index and its inclusive, to index `j`, which is the ending index and its exclusive. Let's check some examples to understand this better.

```go
breadSliceExample1 := breadArr[0:2]
fmt.Println(breadSliceExample1) // output: [ficelle la baguette]
breadSliceExample2 := breadArr[1:3]
fmt.Println(breadSliceExample2) // output: [la baguette brioche]]
```

### Map

Map is a special variant of "array", it is a collection of key-value pairs. You might know it by another name, dictionary. The keys in a map need to be unique. The representation of map looks like `[T(key)]T'(value)`, where `T(key)` is the type of keys and `T'(value)` is the type of associated values. There are no specific limitations on these types but usually, we use primitive types for keys. Let's check out some examples.  

```go
postcodes := make(map[int]string)
postcodes[3000] = "Melbourne"
postcodes[2000] = "Sydney"
postcodes[6000] = "Perth"
fmt.Println(postcodes) // output: map[2000:Sydney 3000:Melbourne 6000:Perth]

// declare map inline with values
postcodesInline := map[int]string{
    3000: "Melbourne",
    2000: "Sydney",
    6000: "Perth",
}
fmt.Println(postcodesInline) // output: map[2000:Sydney 3000:Melbourne 6000:Perth]
```

We use the key to access its associated values in the map.

```go
melbourne := postcodes[3000]
fmt.Println(melbourne) // output: Melbourne
```

However, if the key does not exist in the map, you will get the default value of `T'(value)`. For instance, the output will be an empty string when accessing map using key 8000.

```go
darwin := postcodes[8000]
fmt.Println("darwin is empty string? ", darwin == "") // output: darwin is empty string?  true
```

When accessing the value using a key, map returns a second parameter, which reports whether the key exists or not. We can use that to safely access map or to handle errors.

```go
// check key existed or not
darwin, ok := postcodes[8000]
fmt.Println("is key present in map? ", ok)            // output: is key present in map?  false
fmt.Println("darwin is empty string? ", darwin == "") // darwin: darwin is empty string?  true
```

To add a new pair of data into the map, we can simply inject it like this.

```go
postcodes[4000] = "Brisbane"
fmt.Println(postcodes) // output: map[2000:Sydney 3000:Melbourne 4000:Brisbane 6000:Perth]
```

And to delete a key-value pair, you can use `delete` function like following.

```go
delete(postcodes, 4000)
fmt.Println(postcodes) // output: map[2000:Sydney 3000:Melbourne 6000:Perth]
```

### Struct

Struct is a typed collection of fields, we use it to group information together and to represent real-world objects. We can declare a struct like this:

```go
// The following structs should be declared outside of main function
type Owner struct {
    FirstName   string
    LastName    string
    PhoneNumber string
    Email       string
}
type Account struct {
    BSB           int
    AccountNumber int64
    AccountType   string
    Owners        []Owner
}
```

Between keywords `type` and `struct` is the struct name. By conventions, the struct name should be Pascal cased. Declaring a field inside structs starts with the field name and then its type. There are no limits on the field types. It can be either primitive types or composite types.  
Now we have declared some structs, let's "hydrate" them with some data.

```go
// declare an account
var account1 Account
account1.BSB = 123456
account1.AccountNumber = 12345678
account1.AccountType = "Joint Account"
account1.Owners = []Owner {
    {
        FirstName: "Jon",
        LastName: "Snow",
        PhoneNumber: "0400100200",
        Email: "jon.snow@got.com",
    },
    {
        FirstName: "Daenerys",
        LastName: "Stormborn",
        PhoneNumber: "0400300400",
        Email: "mother.of.dragons@got.com",
    },
}
fmt.Printf("%+v\n", account1) // output is too long

// another way to declare an account inline
account2 := Account {
    BSB: 123456,
    AccountNumber: 12345678,
    AccountType: "Joint Account",
    Owners: []Owner {
        {
            FirstName: "Jon",
            LastName: "Snow",
            PhoneNumber: "0400100200",
            Email: "jon.snow@got.com",
        },
        {
            FirstName: "Daenerys",
            LastName: "Stormborn",
            PhoneNumber: "0400300400",
            Email: "mother.of.dragons@got.com",
        },
    },
}
fmt.Printf("%+v\n", account2) // output is too long
```

We can access the fields in a struct by using `.<fieldName>` syntax on a struct. For example, if we want to know the BSB number of an account struct, we can do `account1.BSB` to get the BSB value.  
Struct is an essential data structure when we start to write applications.  

### Interface

Unlike structs, interface type specifies a collection of functions. It can hold any values of concrete structs that implement the interface. We will look into functions and interfaces further in future tutorials.

```go
// The following interface and struct should be declared outside of main function
// declare an interface
type Animal interface {
    // function sets
    Eat() string
}
// implement an interface
type Dog struct {}
func (d Dog) Eat() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s eats meat", d.Name)
}

// Following code should be inside main function
// declare a variable with interface type
var poodle Animal
poodle = Dog{Name: "Bolt"}
fmt.Println(poodle.Eat()) // output: Bolt eats meat
```

Let's walk through this example and don't worry if it doesn't make sense to you now.  
Firstly, we declared an interface called `Animal` and it has a function called `Eat()`.  
We also declared a struct called `Dog`, it implements the `Animal` interface by having the same function required by the interface.  
Later, when we declared a variable of `Animal` type, we can assign a `Dog` struct to it.  

We will uncover more about the interface type when touching on topics like dependency injection. For now, just keep it in mind that interface is one of the composite types.

## Type conversion & Type assertion

So far, we learned data types and structures of Go. Let's look at other related type topics, type converting and assertion.  

### Conversion

We can convert a type to another if the value makes sense to both types. For example, you can convert int to float or string to int, vice versa.  
To convert between numbers, we can simply use `type(variable)` syntax.  

```Go
convertInt := 1
convertFloat := float32(convertInt)
fmt.Println(convertFloat, reflect.TypeOf(convertFloat)) // output: 1 float32
convertAnotherFloat := 1.8
convertInt = int(convertAnotherFloat)
fmt.Println(convertInt, reflect.TypeOf(convertInt)) // output: 1 int
```

Noted that when trying to convert float to int, Go automatically cuts off the value after the decimal point.  

We can use the built-in package, `strconv`, to handle the conversion of strings. This package quite powerful and covers most of the types. Here are some examples of string conversions.  

```go
// need to import "strconv"
// parse string to boolean
convertBool, err := strconv.ParseBool("true")
fmt.Println(convertBool, reflect.TypeOf(convertBool)) // output: true bool
// convert string to int
strConvertInt, err := strconv.Atoi("-42")
fmt.Println(strConvertInt, reflect.TypeOf(strConvertInt)) // output: -42 int
```

Functions in `strconv` return another parameter for reporting conversion errors. This can be used for error handling and preventing panic errors.

### Assertion

Type assertion provides access to interface's underlying concrete value. Let's use the `Animal` interface example again. Assume that `Dog` struct has another special function called `Bark()`.

```go
func (d Dog) Bark() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s: Woff woff!", d.Name)
}
```

Due to the type of `poodle` is `Animal` interface, we can't access `Dog`'s special functions. To solve this problem, we can use type assertion to assert the type of underlying value.

```go
// Type assertion
// poodle.Bark() // undefined error
p, ok := poodle.(Dog)
fmt.Println(ok, p.Bark()) // output: true Bolt: Woff woff!
```

Similarly, type assertion returns two variables, the first one is the concrete value and the second one is an indicator of whether the assertion is okay or not. After asserting type of `poodle`, we can only access its special function `Bark`.

## Value types vs Reference types

Before we wrap up with data type and structures, I want to point out two more concepts. You probably heard of value types and reference types in other programming languages.  
Value types are copied by value. In other words, changing the value of a copy doesn't affect the original variable. Primitive types in Go are value types.  

```go
valueType := "value"
valueTypeCopy := valueType
valueType = "value changed"
fmt.Println(valueType) // output: value
fmt.Println(valueTypeCopy) // output: value changed
```

Reference types are copied by memory address. In other words, changing the value of a copy does affect the original variable. Composite types in Go are reference types, except for array.  

```go
referenceType := []string{"dog", "cat"}
referenceTypeCopy := referenceType
referenceTypeCopy[1] = "fish"
fmt.Println(referenceType)     // output: dog fish
fmt.Println(referenceTypeCopy) // output: dog fish
```

## What's next?

In the next tutorial, we will talk about loops and logic flows. Stay tuned and I will see you in the next one.
