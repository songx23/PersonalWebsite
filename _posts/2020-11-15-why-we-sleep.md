## 4-hour sleep is enough

One of my ex-colleagues once told me that he only sleeps 4 hours per day and he can get through the day just fine. I was so jealous of him because I need at least 7 hours of sleep every day to be able to get out of my bed in the morning. Time is fair to all beings on Earth. Humans, animals, plants, insects all get 24 hours in a day. Not a second more, not a second less. If a person only needs 4-hour sleep each day, that means they get to do a lot more than those who sleep 8 hours. Let’s do some simple maths.

> # 4 hours * 365 days / 24 hours/day = 60.83 days

Wow, my ex-colleague “lives” two more months than me in a year. Isn’t sleep seem like a total waste of life(time)? I wish I can still function well with only 4-hour sleep at night.

## An interesting book

Recently, I picked up a book called “[Why We Sleep — The New Science of Sleep and Dreams](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep)” by [Matthew Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Walker_(scientist)), who is a scientist and professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. I was hoping to get some tips on how can humans sleep less and still feel energetic and refreshed. However, I was “disappointed”. **This book is talking about the opposite, we need to sleep more, not less.**

## Why we sleep?

Almost every living creature on Earth sleeps. *Don’t quote me on this, but I think even Thanos sleeps*. It’s quite amazing that sleeping behaviour has been around for as long as life itself. It’s embedded in our genes and it didn’t get eliminated by evolution (assuming Darwin’s theory of evolution stands). Sleep must serve a very important purpose, so why do we sleep?

Thanks to the modern developments of neuroscience, we now understand a lot more about sleep and dreams, according to the author Matthew. In the book, he stated many benefits sleep bring to human’s mind and body. Here are some examples of why we should sleep:

### Immune system

A sleep-deprived person, compared to a well-rested person,  has a less effective immune system. After flu shot injections, people who sleep 8 hours per day generates a powerful anti-body immune reaction. Whereas for those who sleep only 4 hours per day, the flu shot produces about 50% less immune reactions. Thus, taking flu shots (only) doesn’t grant us immunity, we need good sleep, too.

### Psychiatric illness

Abnormal brain activities during a specific stage of sleep (NREM, explained in the later sections) among teenagers show higher risks of psychiatric illness such as Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Schizophrenia. Teenagers need to get good quality sleep when they’re on their way to early adulthood.

### Memory and creativity

Sleep helps to reinforce our memory. Both knowledge retention and muscle memory are developed during sleep. Besides, it can also spark creativity. The idea of benzene ring structure is from [Kekulé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Kekul%C3%A9)’s dream of a snake biting its own tail. Truly amazing things happen while we’re dreaming.

### Sleep deprivation and diseases

Sleep deprivation is linked to Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, cancers and even gene damage. Lacking sleep is not necessarily the cause of these diseases but it increases the risk of developing them.

### Car accidents

Police and government have spent heaps of money on preventing drunk driving. Taking naps while driving is just as dangerous as drunk driving. Even a couple seconds of sleep at the wheel can cause catastrophic car accidents. Every year, the number of accidents caused by drowsy driving is pretty much the same as drunk driving.

### Death

Sleep is a necessity to the human body, just like food and water. Humans can survive for about 30 days without food. Total sleep deprivation for about 30 days will result in death as well. Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI) is a genetic disease which has no cure at the moment. One of the symptoms of FFI in the late stage is total sleep deprivation. Once that kicks in, a patient’s lifespan is predictable. Sleeping is really a serious business!

> # Overall, getting enough sleep every day helps us to live a long healthy life. 

** These are not all the benefits mentioned in the book. If you’re interested in more details and the science behind them, I highly recommend you to read the book.*

Sleep is way more important than I thought. I’m sold. If you’re as well, the next question to ask is: How can I get good quality sleep?

Firstly, we need to **sleep long enough**. 4-hour sleep is **NOT** enough for almost any people. We, homo sapiens, need about 8 hours of sleep each day. I’m sure you’ve heard this so many times from your mom and they are right about this, surprisingly (sorry, Mom). Let’s see the reasoning behind this.

When we sleep, we go through different stages of sleep, they are non-rapid eye movement (aka NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (aka REM) sleep namely. NREM sleep is further split into 4 stages. Stage 1–2 is called shallow or light sleep and stage 3–4 is obviously called deep sleep or slow-wave sleep. A full sleep cycle consists of all the sleep stages. It starts from NREM stage 1, to NREM stage 4 and then goes to REM. Each sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes and we go through multiple cycles each night. 

However, each one of those sleep cycles differs from the others a little bit depending on the time when it happens. Taking a deeper look at an 8-hour sleep, the sleep cycle in the first 4 hours focuses more on NREM sleeps than REM sleeps. And we get more REM sleeps in the rest hours. Interestingly, this subtle shift is not adaptive based on how long we sleep. If a person only sleeps 4 hours in the late evening, they will only get REM sleep and their NREM sleep will be deprived no matter how good quality sleep you get. Stripping away any stage of the sleep away for a long time is not a funny thing. As mentioned above, if teens are heavily NREM sleep-deprived, they are at a much higher risk of developing psychiatric illness. Therefore, it’s crucial to have enough time (about 8 hours average) to cover the rhythmic changes between sleep cycles.

## Quality, quality, quality

Sleeping for 8 hours is a good starting point, while it doesn’t guarantee the quality of sleep. People could spend most of the downtime going back and forth between NREM stage 1 and 2, which is not very useful even you sleep 8 hours. In the book, the author generously listed 12 tips for healthy (high quality) sleep, which I won’t repeat here. You can find them via [this link](https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/pdf/MLP_Summer2012web.pdf) (tips are on page 20) and I recommend you at least read these 12 tips.

In this story, I do want to point out a couple of points because it is very related to post-industrial societies, some specific to Australia.

### Get on the beers

Victorians went through a horribly long and strict lockdown to fight COVID-19. For the past two weeks, there are no new infection cases in Victoria, which is wunderbar. When the restrictions were finally going to be lifted, the first question reporters asked was “Can I confirm you are saying we can finally get on the beers?”. And the premier answered “I don’t know that I’ll be drinking a beer tonight. I might go a little higher up the shelf.”

Drinking alcohol, especially beer, is a core part of the Australian culture. However, you’d never thought even a small amount of alcohol consumption can damage the sleep quality (I can almost hear people shouting “this is total bs”, excuse my language). After drinking, you feel very sleepy so you might even  think that alcohol helps you to sleep. Whereas, what alcohol induced is not sleep. The truth is alcohol puts your body into a sedated state, which looks like sleep but it’s not real sleep. It robs REM sleep and deep sleep stages from the sleep cycle. 

If you really want to get on the beers,  do it in the morning. By the time you sleep, they will be out of your system. Oh no, this is so politically incorrect.

### Another cup of coffee

Coffee is another beverage that many Australians can’t live without, especially Melburnians I reckon. Many people drink coffee every morning, which is fine because the effects of caffeine wear off in about 8 hours. However, another cup of coffee in the afternoon, which is not an uncommon ritual in many workplaces, is going to harm the sleep quality in the evening. The caffeine in the  system will give us a hard time when we’re ready to hit the bed.

In the 21st century, our lives are getting better and more people are interested in how to live a healthy life. The general public has focused a lot on what to eat and drink. But sleep seems to be ignored by the societies somehow, while its role is just as important as a healthy diet. Do you ever recall learning anything about sleep at school? I don’t and according to Matthew, most of the education systems don’t include this topic.

Sleep is a worthy subject not only from an individual perspective but also from an educational and organisational perspective. With the current COVID situation, flexible work arrangements (both place and time) are quite common in many industries. This supports employees to have a longer and better sleep in the evening. Companies like Google have dedicated areas for employees to take naps. It’s very good to see organisations are taking more responsibilities on employee’s wellbeing.

I would like to see more people starting to care about their sleep and that’s why I wrote this story to spread the words. Now,

> # Lights off, go to sleep!
