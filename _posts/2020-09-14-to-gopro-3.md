## Flow control

We talked about the basic types and data structures in the last part of the tutorial. In this one, we will talk about flow control and fmt package.

### if

Firstly, let's look at the `if` statements. One of the most basic flow controls is if and else statements. They control the program to execute different code blocks based on conditions. The syntax of `if` statement looks like this.

```go
if conditionA {
    // when condition A is met, execute code here
}
// else if statements
else if conditionB {
    // when condition A is not met and condition B is met, execute code here
}
// else statements
else {
    // when condition A is not met and condition B is not met as well, execute code here
}
```

When conditionA in the if statement returns true, then the code inside the `if` brackets will execute. Otherwise, the conditions below will be evaluated in sequence until reaches the last `else` code block. Go evaluates conditionB next and if conditionB returns true, the code inside will execute. If conditionB returns false, then the last code block will execute. In a combination of `if`, `else if` and `else` statements, the order of evaluations is always from top to the bottom. Therefore, `else` is used as a catch-all block in the end. Of course, you can omit the last `else` block if you don't need a catch-all function.

So what does a condition look like? Anything statements that return a boolean value can be placed in the condition. Here is an example.

```go
// if...else... statement example
grocery := []string{"onion", "milk"}
if len(grocery) <= 2 {
    fmt.Println("Are you sure you have included everything you need in the shopping list?")
} else if len(grocery) < 20 {
    fmt.Println("Looks good. Time to go to the supermarket.")
} else {
    fmt.Println("You have too many things in your shopping list.")
}
// output: Are you sure you have included everything you need in the shopping list.
```

You can also use logic gates in conditions. There are three logic gates, namely and (`&&`), or (`||`), not(`!`). Conditions can be chained together via logic gates to form complex conditions.

```go
// condition with logic gate
covidCaseLimit := 50
dailyNewCOVIDCases := 45
loc, _ := time.LoadLocation("Australia/Melbourne")
if dailyNewCOVIDCases < covidCaseLimit && time.Now().After(time.Date(2020, 9, 28, 0, 0, 0, 0, loc)) {
    fmt.Println("Starting to lift restrictions! :)")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Nope, still in lockdown :(")
}
// output: depends on when you run the program, go have a try yourself ;)
```

There is no limit on how many `else if` statements you can write in a chain of `if...else if ... else`. Whereas for the benefit of readability, we do not recommend having a long list of if/else statements. `switch` is the right choice to handle this scenario. Before we get to it, I want to introduce a special syntax of `if` statements in Go to you.  
Go can accept a "short statement" before the condition in `if`/`else if` statements. This syntax makes the code more concise. It is widely used for error handling, which we will cover in later tutorials. Let's take a look at an example of this syntax.

```go
if location, err := time.LoadLocation("Mars/Somewhere"); err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err) // unknown time zone Mars/Somewhere
    fmt.Println("This is not a valid location on Earth.", "Default time zone:", location)
    // output: This is not a valid location on Earth. Default time zone: UTC
}
// error if trying to print out location
fmt.Println(location) // undefined: location
```

A "short statement" is a declaration of one or more variables, they are short-lived and only accessible inside the closest brackets. In the example above, if we try to access the variable in the short statement outside the `if` code block, we will get an error back. A common error handling pattern in Go uses short statements to check if there is an error returned by a function. Since the error returned is only related to the `if` condition, we can use the "short statement" syntax to make code more concise and avoid confusions of variable scopes.  

#### Variable scope

Let me quickly explain what is the scope of a variable. Not all variables are declared equally. Their accessibility depends on the place of declarations. For instance, if a variable is declared inside an `if` block, we can only access it inside the same code block, not from outside. A general rule of thumb is: the reach of a variable is bounded with its closest brackets (`{}`).  

```go
// variable scopes
if _, err := time.LoadLocation("Mars/Somewhere"); err != nil {
    anotherPlace := "Asgard"
    fmt.Println("This is not a valid location on Earth. Choosing somewhere else...", anotherPlace)
} else {
    newPlace := "New Asgard"
    fmt.Println(newPlace, "is a valid location on Earth.")
}
// errors as the variables are out of scope
fmt.Println(anotherPlace) // undefined: anotherPlace
fmt.Println(newPlace) // undefined: newPlace
```

In the example above, `anotherPlace` and `newPlace` are only accessible within the closest brackets around them. If there's no bracket around a variable, then it is a global variable inside the package. We will discuss accessibility when we touch on packages. For now, remembering the bracket rule is sufficient.

### switch

Alright, enough distractions. Let's get back to the flow control. I mentioned that when we have a long list of conditions, it's better to use `switch` statements than  `if` statements. `switch` is a cleaner form of `if`, which looks like this.

```go
// switch statement
numText := "one"
switch numText {
    case "one":
        fmt.Println(numText, "=", 1)
    case "two":
        fmt.Println(numText, "=", 2)
    default:
        fmt.Println(numText, "is not 1 or 2")
}
// output: one = 1
```

The example switch statement can transform to `if` statement like below.

```go
// transform switch to if
if numText == "one" {
    fmt.Println(numText, "=", 1)
else if numText == "two"{
    fmt.Println(numText, "=", 2)
} else {
    fmt.Println(numText, "is not 1 or 2")
}
```

Switch statement compares its associated variable with values in the `case` statements inside. If it finds a match, the code inside that `case` block will be executed. Once that block is finished, the program exits the switch block without checking other cases. The last `default` block is like the `else` statement.  
You might not feel it is easier to write `switch` statement if there are only 3 conditions to check. But imagine if you need to write 10 conditions like this, `switch` will look much cleaner and concise than `if`.

`switch` also has a more generic form where we don't need to specify a variable after it, instead, conditions can be specified in `case` statements. For instance:

```go
// generic switch statement
switch {
case "one" == "1":
    fmt.Println("This is impossible")
case dailyNewCOVIDCases < covidCaseLimit && time.Now().After(time.Date(2020, 9, 28, 0, 0, 0, 0, loc)):
    fmt.Println("Easing lockdown")
default:
    fmt.Println("Catching all other scenarios")
}
// output: depending on the time you execute the program, it can either be "Easing lockdown"
//  or "Catching all other scenarios"
```

Yes, case conditions in the generic switch statement can be any conditions that fit an `if` statement (excluding the special short statement syntax).  
So when should we use `if` and when should we use `switch`? In my opinion, they're interchangeable in many cases. Personally, I will choose whichever is cleaner visually and uses lesser lines of code.

## Loop

When we need to execute logic repeatedly, a loop is the best helper. Nobody wants to copy-paste duplicated code over and over again. In other languages, you've probably seen loops such as `for` loops and `while` loops. But in Go, there is only `for` loop.

### for

For loop has four forms in Go.

#### Basic form

The most basic form of `for` loop looks exactly the same in many languages. For your information, I rarely use this form in real projects.  

```go
// for loop: basic
// import strings
lockdownLevels := []string{"stage1", "stage2", "stage3", "stage4"}
for i:=0; i < len(lockdownLevels); i++ {
    switch {
        case strings.Contains(lockdownLevels[i], "1"):
            fmt.Println("In", lockdownLevels[i], "lockdown. Life is great.")
        case strings.Contains(lockdownLevels[i], "2"):
            fmt.Println("In", lockdownLevels[i], "lockdown. Life is good.")
        case strings.Contains(lockdownLevels[i], "3"):
            fmt.Println("In", lockdownLevels[i], "lockdown. Life is not too bad.")
        case strings.Contains(lockdownLevels[i], "4"):
            fmt.Println("In", lockdownLevels[i], "lockdown. Life is not so good.")
        default:
            fmt.Println("Unknown lockdown stage")
    }
}
// output:
//  In stage1 lockdown. Life is great.
//  In stage2 lockdown. Life is good.
//  In stage3 lockdown. Life is not too bad.
//  In stage4 lockdown. Life is not so good.
```

Let's quickly go through the basic form syntax.  
There are three short statements in the for loop above and they are separated by `;`s. The first short statement is for initiating the loop index. Usually, it starts with 0. The second short statement is the loop condition. As long as the loop condition is met, the loop keeps executing until the loop condition returns `false`. And the last statement is the stepping function. We specify what's going to change in each iteration. Most of the time, it's going to be increasing/decreasing the loop index. The example above shows us how we can loop through a slice. We start with setting the loop index to 0. The loop should exit after reaching the last element in the slice. Thus, we set the condition to "loop index needs to be smaller than the length of the slice". Lastly, we set the stepping function to "increase the index by 1".  
To be noted, all these three short statements are optional. We will see its different implications below.

#### While form

There's no `while` keyword in Go. While form is just a variant of the basic `for` loop. If we omit the initiation and stepping function from the basic form, we will get the while form. Therefore, as long as the loop condition is met, the loop will keep executing. The example above can be easily transformed to while form like this.

```go
// for loop: while form
whileIndex := 0
for whileIndex < len(lockdownLevels) {
    switch {
    case strings.Contains(lockdownLevels[whileIndex], "1"):
        fmt.Println("In", lockdownLevels[whileIndex], "lockdown. Life is great.")
    case strings.Contains(lockdownLevels[whileIndex], "2"):
        fmt.Println("In", lockdownLevels[whileIndex], "lockdown. Life is good.")
    case strings.Contains(lockdownLevels[whileIndex], "3"):
        fmt.Println("In", lockdownLevels[whileIndex], "lockdown. Life is not too bad.")
    case strings.Contains(lockdownLevels[whileIndex], "4"):
        fmt.Println("In", lockdownLevels[whileIndex], "lockdown. Life is not so good.")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Unknown lockdown stage")
    }
    whileIndex++
}
// output: same as above
```

#### Endless form

Endless loop, also known as "dead loop", is a dangerous loop. Normally, if we have an endless loop, it's going to break the program because it can devour all the resources the program can get which can crash the host system in result. That's normally a very bad thing. However, in Go, there are some special use cases where we can use endless loops for good. For instance, when you want to run an async background process, you can create an endless loop and let it running in background. I promise, that won't yield a catastrophic outcome. To write an endless loop, just omit all three statements in the basic form.

```go
go func() {
    for {
        fmt.Println("I'm an endless loop.")
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    }
}()

time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
// output: 5 rows of I'm an endless loop.
```

Of course, I'm not going to break your computer by asking you to run an endless loop directly in the main function. What we are doing here is to run it in a goroutine (will be covered in future). Goroutine enables async processing, hence our endless loop runs in parallel of the main process. While the main process sleeps for 5 seconds, the async process should execute the endless loop continuously until the main process exits. That's why we see "I'm an endless loop." printed 5 times in the console.

#### Range operator

Last but not the least, let's talk about the range operator. It helps to easily iterate over types like slices/arrays, maps, channels and strings. Let's see how we can simplify the basic form.

```go
// for loop: range operator over slice/array
for index, value := range lockdownLevels {
    fmt.Print("Index ", index, ": ")
    switch {
    case strings.Contains(value, "1"):
        fmt.Println("In", value, "lockdown. Life is great.")
    case strings.Contains(value, "2"):
        fmt.Println("In", value, "lockdown. Life is good.")
    case strings.Contains(value, "3"):
        fmt.Println("In", value, "lockdown. Life is not too bad.")
    case strings.Contains(value, "4"):
        fmt.Println("In", value, "lockdown. Life is not so good.")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Unknown lockdown stage")
    }
}
// output:
//  Index 0: In stage1 lockdown. Life is great.
//  Index 1: In stage2 lockdown. Life is good.
//  Index 2: In stage3 lockdown. Life is not too bad.
//  Index 3: In stage4 lockdown. Life is not so good.
```

When applying range operator on a slice or an array, it provides two variables for each iteration, namely the index and value of current iteration. Note that these variables are short-lived and scoped to each iteration, they can only be accessed inside the loop. Usually, we don't need the index, so we can omit assigning a variable by using `_`. It will look like this `for _, value := range slice {...}`. In fact, if you don't use any of the variables inside the loop, Go will force you to omit them.  
Iterating through a map using range operator also returns two variables. Except, it returns keys instead of indexes for maps.

```go
// for loop: range operator over map
postcodes := map[int]string{
    3000: "Melbourne",
    2000: "Sydney",
    6000: "Perth",
}
for key, value := range postcodes {
    fmt.Println("Postcode:", key, "Name:", value)
}
// output:
//  Postcode: 2000 Name: Sydney
//  Postcode: 6000 Name: Perth
//  Postcode: 3000 Name: Melbourne
```

Similarly, we need to omit any variables returned by range operator if we don't use them.  
Range operator returns two variables when applied on a string, or String type. The first one is the same as slice/array, which is an index. The second one is the Unicode (represented by int32) of the character.  

```go
// for loop: range operator over string
helloString := "Hello!"
for _, u := range helloString {
    // using fmt package to format the output
    fmt.Printf("Unicode: %U; Character: %c", u, u)
}
// output:
//  Unicode: U+0048; Character: H
//  Unicode: U+0065; Character: e
//  Unicode: U+006C; Character: l
//  Unicode: U+006C; Character: l
//  Unicode: U+006F; Character: o
//  Unicode: U+0021; Character: !
```

In this example, you can see that we used a new function from the fmt package. It's time to explain the formatting capabilities of the fmt package. You can skip to the last section to have a sneak peek.

Looping through channel type is a bit advance at this stage. We will cover that later when we touch more on goroutines and asynchronous processing.  

#### continue & break

`continue` and `break` are the short-circuit statements for skipping iterations. When using `continue`, the program will skip the code execution after `continue` and start the next iteration. While `break` is more forceful, the program will skip the entire loop when it sees `break`.

```go
// continue
for key, value := range postcodes {
    if key == 6000 {
        continue // skip the following code for current iteration
    }
    fmt.Printf("Postcode: %d Name: %s\n", key, value)
}
// output:
//  Postcode: 2000 Name: Sydney
//  Postcode: 3000 Name: Melbourne

// break
for key, value := range postcodes {
    if key == 6000 {
        break // skip the entire loop
    }
    fmt.Printf("Postcode: %d Name: %s\n", key, value)
}
// output:
//  Postcode: 2000 Name: Sydney
```

#### goto & label

`goto` and `label` enable jumping from a statement to another line of code in the same function. The convention of label names is to use all capital letters.  

```go
// goto & label
    fmt.Println("First line of code.")
    goto SKIP;
    fmt.Println("Second line of code.") // this line is skipped
SKIP: fmt.Println("Third line of code.")
// output:
//  First line of code.
//  Third line of code.
```

#### defer

`defer` is the last flow control statement I want to cover in this tutorial. It is used for deferring function execution until the closest surrounding function exits. Here is an example.

```go
// defer
dText := "defer #1"
defer fmt.Println(dText)
dText = "defer #2"
defer fmt.Println(dText)
// do something else
dText = "not deferred"
fmt.Println(dText)
// output:
//  not deferred
//  defer #2
//  defer #1
```

As shown in the example, the statements after `defer` were executed in the end when exiting the main function. To be noted, the execution sequence of a series of `defer` statements is reversed. In other words, the last stated `defer` will execute first when exiting the function. Also, the arguments inside `defer` statements are evaluated inline. That is the only thing which is not deferred.  
`defer` is useful when we create something that is better to be closed or removed by the end of a function. Without `defer`, we need to write an open statement in the beginning and then close it in the end. This is error-prone as it's very easy to forget closing it. With `defer`, we can write a `defer close()` statement right after opening. That way, it's less likely to forget. We will use it when touching on database connections, HTTP servers in the advanced topics.

## Bonus content: fmt package

I'm sure, you are quite familiar with `fmt.Println` function. We used it a lot to print results in the console. `fmt` is a powerful built-in formatting package of Go. `Println` is one of the functions in the package. You can find the documentation of the fmt package [here](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/). There are quite a few contents there. I'm not going to go through them one by one in this tutorial. What I want to point out is the formatter in this package. Using formatter can save us time and lines of code when manipulating strings.  
You will find some of the functions have a trailing "f" in the function name. This is an indication that those functions accept formatter as parameters. So how do we use the formatter? Let's check out this example of `Printf` function.  

```go
// basic usage of formatter
whoami := "formatter"
fmt.Printf("Hello, I'm your helpful %s\n", whoami)
// output: Hello, I'm your helpful formatter
```

The first parameter in `Printf` is the format string and the following parameters are the arguments that will replace the format 'verbs'. In the example above, format verb `%s` is replaced by the `whoami` value. You can place as many arguments as you want after the format string. However, the only requirement is the number of format verbs needs to match the number of arguments.  
The core of this formatter lies in the format verbs, let's check out different types of format verbs below, if you want to see the full list of format verbs, you can find them in the documentation of `fmt` package.  

### Booleans

The only available format verb for boolean is `%t`, it will format the boolean value to string value ("true" or "false").

```go
// format verbs: boolean
booleanTrue := true
fmt.Printf("Boolean in text: %t\n", booleanTrue) // output: Boolean in text: true
```

### Numbers

Numbers have more format verbs. Here are some of the mostly used ones.

1. `%b`: base 2 number
2. `%d`: base 10 number
3. `%U`: Unicode format
4. `%e`/`%E`: scientific notation
5. `%f`: decimal point number

Let's see them in action.

```go
// format verbs: numbers
smallInt := 111
smallFloat := 111.11
largeFloat := 111111111111111.0
fmt.Printf(`Binary number: %b
Base 10 number: %d
Unicode: %U
Decimal point: %f
Scientific notationL %e
`, smallInt, smallInt, smallInt, smallFloat, largeFloat)
// output:
//  Binary number: 1101111
//  Base 10 number: 111
//  Unicode: U+006F
//  Decimal point: 111.110000
//  Scientific notationL 1.111111e+14
```

*Note: the format string wrapped with backticks are the same as normal double quotes. However, backtick allows writing a single string in multiple lines.*

### Strings

Format verbs for strings:

1. `%s`: string
2. `%q`: string wrapped with double quotes, safely escaped

```go
// format verbs: string
simpleString := "I am a happy formatter"
quotedString := `"I am a happy double quoted formatter"`
fmt.Printf(`Plain string: %s
Quoted string: %q
Safely escaped quoted string: %q
`, simpleString, simpleString, quotedString)
// output:
//  Plain string: I am a happy formatter
//  Quoted string: "I am a happy formatter"
//  Safely escaped quoted string: "\"I am a happy double quoted formatter\""
```

### General

Last but not the least, let's check out some format verbs for general types.

1. `%v`: value in default format
2. `%+v`: prints field names when value is a struct
3. `%#v`: prints Go-syntax representation of the value

```go
// format verbs: general

// struct should be declared outside of main function
type Person struct {
    Name   string
    Gender string
    DoB    time.Time
    Age    int
    Hobby  []string
}

simpleSlice := []string{"1", "2", "3", "Go"}
simpleMap := map[string]string{
    "%v":  "value in default format",
    "%+v": "value + field names",
}
simpleStruct := Person{
    Name:   "TesterUser",
    Gender: "Secret",
    DoB:    time.Date(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, loc),
    Age:    50,
    Hobby:  []string{"Go", "Programming", "Break stuff", "Push buttons"},
}
fmt.Printf(`Default format of slice: %v
Default format of map: %v
Default format of struct: %v
struct with field names: %+v
Go-syntax representation of slice: %#v
Go-syntax representation of map: %#v
Go-syntax representation of struct: %#v
`, simpleSlice, simpleMap, simpleStruct, simpleStruct, simpleSlice, simpleMap, simpleStruct)
// output:
//  Default format of slice: [1 2 3 Go]
//  Default format of map: map[%+v:value + field names %v:value in default format]
//  Default format of struct: {TesterUser Secret 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +1000 AEST 50 [Go Programming Break stuff Push buttons]}
//  struct with field names: {Name:TesterUser Gender:Secret DoB:1970-01-01 00:00:00 +1000 AEST Age:50 Hobby:[Go Programming Break stuff Push buttons]}
//  Go-syntax representation of slice: []string{"1", "2", "3", "Go"}
//  Go-syntax representation of map: map[string]string{"%+v":"value + field names", "%v":"value in default format"}
//  Go-syntax representation of struct: main.Person{Name:"TesterUser", Gender:"Secret", DoB:time.Time{wall:0x0, ext:62135560800, loc:(*time.Location)(0xc0000261e0)}, Age:50, Hobby:[]string{"Go", "Programming", "Break stuff", "Push buttons"}}
```

More often, we don't really need to print out strings in the console. We only need to format strings and use them in the program. Luckily, there's another function called `Sprintf`. It's the same as `Printf`, the only difference is `Sprintf` returns formatted string back as a variable.  

## What's next?

In the next tutorial, we will talk about pointers and functions. Stay tuned and I will see you in the next one.
