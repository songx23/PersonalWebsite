### Spotlight

I visited Tokyo on my holiday last year, it is a massive city and I was very impressed. The people are helpful and friendly, most of them can understand English. Food there is off the charts, Sukiyaki, Steak, Sushi, Ramen and lots delicious street food, I love all of them.

This set is featuring the following landmarks:

- Tokyo Tower & Tokyo Skytree  
    These are both tall and a great place to see the whole city. However, due to their popularity, usually there's a bit of queuing to the top. I went to another place which can see the same city view but much cheaper and less crowded, it's the top levels of Roppongi Hills building. I'd recommend to visit in the evening, the night view is fantastic. Be aware it's very windy on the helipad so be prepared.
- Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower  
    I saw the building from far. It's just another skyscraper in Tokyo.
- Chidorigafuchi Park  
  This park is famous for the cherry blossom in April. Locals gather around here to see the cherry blossom and have picnic every year. It's a quite and 
- Shibuya Crossing  
  This is one of the busiest crossings in the world. I walked across this without even notice this is the famous crossing. The loyal dog Hachi statue is located next to the crossing, in front of the train station.
- Tokyo Big Sight  
  I did not have time to visit Big Sight but I do went to the bay area briefly. The impressive thing is the train I took to get there is fully automatic, no human controlling it at all. The way to Tokyo Bay is beautiful as well.
- Mt. Fuji  
  Absolutely majestic mountain. However, it's often covered in clouds. So check weather forecast before visiting.
