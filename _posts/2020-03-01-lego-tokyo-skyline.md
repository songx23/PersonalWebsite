### Spotlight

I visited Tokyo on my holiday last year, I was very impressed by how massive and modern this city is. The locals are very helpful and friendly, most of them understand English. One thing I loved the most is the food there, such as Sukiyaki, Steak, Sushi, Ramen and lots delicious street food.

This set is featuring the following landmarks:

1. Tokyo Tower & Tokyo Skytree  
    These are both great places to enjoy the whole city view. However, due to their popularity, usually there's a bit of queuing to the top. I went to another place which can see the same city view but much cheaper and less crowded, it's the top levels of Roppongi Hills building. I'd recommend to visit in the evening, the night view is fantastic. Be aware it's very windy on the helipad so be prepared.  
2. Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower  
    I saw the building from far, it's just another skyscraper in Tokyo.
3. Chidorigafuchi Park  
    This park is famous for the cherry blossom in April. Locals gather around here to see the cherry blossom and have picnic every year. The mini cherry trees are quite cute in this set.
4. Shibuya Crossing  
    This is one of the busiest crossings in the world. The first time I walked across it, I didn't even notice this is the famous crossing.
5. Tokyo Big Sight  
    I did not have time to visit the Big Sight (aka Tokyo International Exhibition Center) but I do went to the bay area briefly. The impressive thing is the train I took to get there is fully automatic, no humans controlling it at all. The way to Tokyo Bay is beautiful as well. This route is highly recommended.
6. Mt. Fuji  
    Absolutely majestic mountain. I don't need to say anything about Mt. Fuji, everyone knows how beautiful it is. Whereas the top of the mountain is often covered in clouds. So check weather forecast before visiting.

Overall, this is a fun set to build and I would love to go back to Japan to visit other amazing cities.
