## How and why I started to read Deep work

It has been 50+ business days since I started to work from home due to COVID-19 lock down. In the first week, I enjoyed the better setup at home and no commuting. However, WFH slowly becomes chaotic and unpleasant. As the project is close to release, my calendar started to fill up with meetings. Gradually, my work life switches from putting out fire somewhere to having meetings over and over again. To be honest, I had enough and I'm sick of this pattern going on.  
One day, I saw one of my colleagues' slack status saying "Deep Work" with a stop sign next to the text. Deep work is a new concept to me, I understand what it means but I'm very curious about where does this come from. After quick googling, I found there is a book called "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World". The title hit me, I decided to read this book immediately.  
This book is written by a professor of computer science, so it's very well structured and easy to understand. Personally, I think most of the rules are useful and I might be able to apply them in my work. Some of them are a bit hard to implement for me but it might be natural for other industries.
