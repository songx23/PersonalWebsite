# Work from home tips - a guide to be productive at home

## Heading towards the entrance of an old tunnel

It has been I-forgot-how-many business days since I started to work from home in Australia due to COVID-19. Before the nationwide lock down happened, My colleagues and I were anxiously waiting for an email to tell us that we can start working from home. And I remember clearly we cheered when we finally received the long-waited "work from home" email. All of us happily went home and started to WFH without what's really heading toward our way.
The first couple of weeks were great. I didn't need to drive to work which takes about 2 hours round trip. I enjoyed better setup at home. However, that good feeling didn't last long. My working day slowly turned to a chaotic, unorganized mess that I can hardly get through. How did that happen? I'm glad you asked.

## Entering the tunnel

The biggest challenge I found remote work has brought is communication. We have to retreat to lower bandwidth communication channels like texting or conference calls which make team work much less efficient. Here's an example of an unpleasant day. Out of the 8 working hours, 4 hours were occupied by different meetings, 3 hours were spent to deal with text-based communication (emails, slack messages) and put out random fires. And there was only one single hour left to do some actual work. To make things worse, this hour was split into small pieces and scattered all over the place.

In the first week, I enjoyed the better setup at home and no commuting. However, WFH slowly becomes chaotic and unpleasant. As the project is close to release, my calendar started to fill up with meetings. Gradually, my work life switches from putting out fire somewhere to having meetings over and over again. To be honest, I had enough and I'm sick of this pattern going on.  
One day, I saw one of my colleagues' slack status saying "Deep Work" with a stop sign next to the text. Deep work is a new concept to me, I understand what it means but I'm very curious about where does this come from. After quick googling, I found there is a book called "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World". The title hit me, I decided to read this book immediately.  
This book is written by a professor of computer science, so it's very well structured and easy to understand. Personally, I think most of the rules are useful and I might be able to apply them in my work. Some of them are a bit hard to implement for me but it might be natural for other industries.  

## TL;DR

// summarize the entire book in three sentences

## What is deep work
