## Entering a dark tunnel

It has been I-forgot-how-many days since I started to work from home in Australia due to COVID-19. Before the government announced the nationwide lockdown, many organisations had asked their employee to work from home. I work for one of the four big banks in Australia, and their actions are usually slower than others. Everyone was hoping we could start work from home soon and I clearly remember we cheered when we finally received the long-awaited "work from home" email. I truly believed that I would enjoy work from home at that time.
The first a couple of weeks were indeed excellent. I was driving to work to avoid public transportation. Therefore, I happily took the hours spent on commuting back and reallocated them to sleep in the morning. Apart from that, I have much better work setup, such as a larger monitor and stand desk, at home.
However, that good feeling didn't last long. After the honeymoon period, my working days gradually turned into a chaotic, unorganised mess. As a software engineer, usually, I spend most of my day solving engineering problem and implementing them. Sometimes, that requires collaboration with teammates and colleagues from other teams. Since we all started working from home, collaboration became much more inefficient. It began to eat up the time which I used to work on the engineering part of my job. Eventually, it degenerated to a point where I had to spend the whole day collaborating. To me, I felt defeated when I got nothing substantial done apart from meetings and emails by the end of the day. Work from home became a long dark tunnel that I entered but also got trapped in it.

## Seeing lights from the exit

One day, I saw one of my colleague's slack status changed "Deep Work" with a brain emoji. Hmmm, what's deep work? I thought. Is it some kinds of work spies do? After quick googling, I found this concept comes from a book called "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World". This book is like a light shining in the darkness; I decided to read it immediately.  
This book is written by a successful computer science professor, Cal Newport. He's also known as an author of popular self-improvement books, "Deep Work" being one of them.

### TL;DR

To summarise the entire book in three simple sentences:
Deep work is a valuable but rare skill in this digital world.
Deep work enables us to learn complicated things quickly and to produce top quality work.
Deep work is a skill that can be cultivated and trained; however, that is not an easy path.

### What exactly is deep work

Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.
These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and hard to replicate.

### The values that deep work brings

#### Learning

The information economy is built on complex systems, which are changing rapidly, especially for things like programming languages, application frameworks, software, hardware, etc. It is nearly impossible to comprehend everything in this world. Therefore, the ability to learn and master new and complicated stuff becomes a core competitive edge in profession world.
Deep work facilitates fast learning because it forces you to enter a highly concentrated state. Backed by psychology and neuroscience researches, we, human, can acquire knowledge and skills much faster when deep-working comparing to shallow-working (learn when distracted).

#### Perfection

The digital network revolution creates a significant impact on our choices of products. The reach of an exceptional quality product is virtually limitless; meanwhile, for the subpar products, they become harder to get tractions. Therefore, only the ones that are in the lead positions can survive in the network.
Deep work pushes us to a state where we can produce high-quality work, which in turn helps us to seek perfection and to thrive in the network.

## Walking towards the exit

After I finished reading "Deep Work", I learned a few useful techniques which I would love to share with you. They helped me to concentrate and to improve my productivity at work.

### The power of routine

No doubt, focusing is quite hard nowadays; we need to avoid many distractions before we can sit down and work on one and only one thing. Our mind behaves like electricity in a circuit which always flows through the least resistant path (the path with lest Electrical resistance) first. It prefers noncognitive-demanding tasks which often performed while distracted. I'm sure everyone has something like that on the to-do list every day. Performing shallow works is not challenging, and it does not contribute to your professional growth. So to convince our mind taking the other path, which is cognitive-demanding jobs, we will need tremendous will power to steer it. Though a person's will power is finite per day, and it depletes as you use it, there is a trick to preserve our limited will power for deep work.
Developing a deep work routine can set you on auto-pilot. Setting up such a schedule for deep work is not hard, but it takes a lot of work to stick to it. If you can, I suggest putting deep work times on your calendar; this can help you avoid unexpected distractions. The times I chose for deep work are right after the lunch break and the last business hour, about 1.5 to 2 hours per day. I'm less likely to be disturbed by others and have meetings scheduled at those times. We don't live in a perfect world; sometimes, we have to break our routine to do something elseâ€”no need to stress about it. The principle is not to yield to distractions without a fight.
Including rests in the routine is essential. Performing deep work can be mentally exhaustive. We need to recharge our will power and energy for future deep work. Developing such a habit is easier said than done. You can use techniques such as "Don't break the chain." to keep yourself motivated.

### Schedule for distractions

Now we have embedded our deep work routine in the calendar, what should we do for the rest of the days? 
Without a schedule or a plan, we would be pushed around by many other things that come to us. You can only find peace when deep working and that's only about a fourth of your day. It probably wouldn't be a pleasant experience as most of the day is still chaotic and unorganised. To regain full control of your day, you need to schedule not only for concentrations but also for distractions.
Every morning before start working, I take 3 minutes to plan for distractions in the eight business hours. I set up three levels of distractions and allocate hours to each of them.

#### Deep work (sort of)

Deep work (aka my deep work routine) are marked as yellow. During that time, I can access Google to search for work-related topics such as API documentation and StackOverflow, but nothing more than that. Ideally, it would be great if you can disconnect from the Internet entirely. Whereas it is a bit difficult for a developer to work without Internet access. So I relaxed the rules a little bit. Depending on the industries, you can come up with your own rules as long as it's reasonable. I use deep work time to focus on designing, implementing and discovering.

#### Meetings

Meetings are marked as blue. During meetings, I can access nothing but the mute button and meeting materials. I know it's very tempting to do something trivial when you're not talking, but that takes you out of the meeting context. It takes your limited will power to bring yourself back. On the other hand, if all attendees are focused, meetings can usually finish quicker, which saves more time in the end. You can reallocate the surplus time to something more meaningful such as rest or deep work. 

#### Distractions

Last but not least, it is the grey area, which means full distractions. I can access emails, Slack and even Youtube. This time is usually for team collaboration, defects handling and chitchats. As you can see, most of my day is still coloured in grey because abandoning communication with the team is impossible to me. However, it doesn't mean how busy I am and how fast I respond to messages/emails represents my values in the team. This is a typical mentality that knowledge workers have, especially when working from home. On the contrary, my values to the organisation are represented by how well I design the solutions, how neat I implement logics, etc.

Overall, scheduling can help you take back control of your day. Trust me; that will bring you a very satisfying feeling. Of course, you do not have to stick to the plan 100 per cent, just try to do your best. I know meetings can be rescheduled even minutes before they start. Sigh.

### Disconnect

Disconnect from the Internet is a must to avoid distractions but, to be honest, it is one of the toughest things I've ever done. During the deep work hours, I close my Outlook and Slack after setting a Slack status to let others know I am not reading any messages. If they want to reach me, come back later.
Is it enough just to disable notifications but leave the apps open? I'd say no. As long as they're open, it will be tempting to check them. Shutting down all the online communication channels can force you to concentrate. I know, disconnection is scary but the world won't collapse if you are offline for an hour or so. I've done it many times now, and it hasn't brought me any troubles. What I did not expect is my colleagues seem to respect my short absence without me even explaining why. Once I am back online, messages start to flow through, and nobody ever complained so far. Disconnect from the sources of distraction is both the easiest and hardest thing to do, but I strongly recommend trying it out.

### Communicate smarter

When working from home, we spent a significant amount of hours reading and writing emails. Although email is categorised as a distraction, it doesn't mean you should treat it as shallow work. It is still well worth to put some careful thoughts into handling emails.
The first thing you can do is to improve how you read emails. Creating rules to sort inbox automatically is an excellent place to start. Grouping emails based on their sources is an efficient way to reduce time on reading unimportant emails. I have a folder dedicated to everything sent from Confluence and JIRA. These emails are notifications of changes on tickets or pages, which are pure noises to me. I have another rule to move all Github emails to a separate folder. These emails usually are related to PR reviews, which are quite important to me. Hence having them sorted into different places saves me a fair bit of time to go through my inbox. You can define your own rules to suit your use cases, most popular email clients have this function built-in, and it is a breeze to set them up. Have your email client work harder for you, so you don't need to work as hard.
When writing emails, a quick response is not always the best option; sometimes, no reply is the best reply. The aim is to save time in the long term. 
You probably have seen emails going back and forth many times in a short while. A conversation like this is a waste of time for all parties. A quick reply in the short term provides you with some relief as you bounce the responsibility off your court. However, others will eventually kick the ball back to you, again and again, continually sapping your time and attention. To provide a better response, you need to focus not only on the current step but also the next step. It can significantly mitigate the impact on distractions email brings; for example, it reduces the number of emails in your inbox as well as reducing the times you switch contexts.
Sometimes, it would be better not to reply to an email at all. If any of the following applies to an email, it's probably better not to respond.

1. It's ambiguous
2. Nothing good will happen if you reply, and nothing terrible will happen if you don't reply

Avoiding replies to these kinds of emails can prevent confusing other people further as well as sparking unnecessary worries across multiple parties. In turns, it saves time to provide further explanations.
The methods mentioned above should win you some time back.  Hooray, one second saved is one more second for deep work.

## Walking out of the tunnel

Finally, I walked out of the long dark tunnel, leaving the distracted masses and joining the focused few. I hope the techniques above can also help you take control of your days during this hard time. What tips and tricks do you have up your sleeves? I'd love to hear them in the comment section.
