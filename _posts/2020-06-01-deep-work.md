# Work from home tips - a guide to be productive at home

## Heading towards the entrance of an old tunnel

It has been I-forgot-how-many business days since I started to work from home in Australia due to COVID-19. Before the nationwide lock down happened, My colleagues and I were anxiously waiting for an email to tell us that we can start working from home. And I remember clearly we cheered when we finally received the long-waited "work from home" email. All of us happily went home and started to WFH without what's really heading toward our way.
The first couple of weeks were great. I didn't need to drive to work which takes about 2 hours round trip. I enjoyed better setup at home. However, that good feeling didn't last long. My working days slowly turned to a chaotic, unorganized mess that I can hardly get through. How did that happen? I'm glad you asked. If you are experiencing a similar struggle, follow me along into this "tunnel". After we go through the tunnel, I hope I can help you to find some peace in this unrest world.

## Entering a dark tunnel

The biggest challenge I found remote work has brought is communication. We have to retreat to lower bandwidth communication channels like texting or conference calls which make team work much less efficient. Video calls? Oh I wish we have the proper network infrastructure that can support smooth video calls in Australia. But due to various limitations, audio calls are the best we have, at least for the company I work for.

To demonstrate how bad this can get to, let me break out how I spend my 8 working hours on a "bad" day. My outlook calendar is filled with meetings with different topics. It might be normal for a management role but for an engineer, why would I need to attend so many meetings? When I start to get through the day, emails start to fly into my inbox. They are the kind of email that needs immediate attention. If not, you're blocking other teams from progressing their tasks. In between handling of meetings and emails, I find some small pieces of time that I use to work on my planned task. A day like this  is very exhausting. My mind keeps switching between different contexts. I'm constantly worried about missing a meeting or blocking other's work. As I can hardly concentrate, my efficiency drops as well and this situation goes into a negative feedback loop. 

I'm glad that not every day is like what I describe but at least once every week, I need to go through this. I felt like I entered a dark tunnel and I was scrawling through it. There is no end in sight to this mayhem. 

## A tiny light in sight

One day, I saw one of my colleague's slack status saying "Deep Work" with a stop emoji. Hmmm... what's deep work? I thought. Sounds like the kind of work spies do. After a quick googling, I found there's a book called "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World". This title shined a tiny light at the end of the tunnel, I decided to read this book immediately.
