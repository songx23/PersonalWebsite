### Academic Publication

I have published an academic paper about an Internet of Things platform I built.
The purpose of this platform is to enable users to create their own "smart" spaces. Users can integrate their devices (sensors, controllers and etc.) to the platform and design multi-artifact systems by using a simple rule engine. 

The platform is targeted to all user types. Non-tech savvy users can use public sensors to control a public space tailored to their needs. IoT developers, hardware engineers can set up public/private devices and share their ways to create meaningful multi-artifact systems.
