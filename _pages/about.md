### 2016 GE Industrial Hackathon

I participated in 2016 GE Industrial Hackathon. The challenge was to design an interactive system for railway maintenance workers to lookup complicated maintenance procedures and log faults. After two days of hacking, me and my team won the third prize of the hackathon. Amazon sponsored 1000 USD credits on AWS for the team.

### Academic Publication

I have published an academic paper about an Internet of Things platform I built.
The purpose of this platform is to enable users to create their own "smart" spaces. Users can integrate their devices (sensors, controllers and etc.) to the platform and design multi-artifact systems by using a simple rule engine. 

The platform is targeted to all user types. Non-tech savvy users can use public sensors to control a public space tailored to their needs. IoT developers, hardware engineers can set up public/private devices and share their ways to create meaningful multi-artifact systems.
